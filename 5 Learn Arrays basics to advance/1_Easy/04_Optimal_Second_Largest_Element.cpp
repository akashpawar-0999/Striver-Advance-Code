Input: nums = [8, 8, 7, 6, 5]
Output: 7
Explanation: The largest value in nums is 8, the second largest is 7

Input: nums = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The only value in nums is 10, so there is no second largest value, thus -1 is returned


Input:[1, 2, 4, 7, 7, 5]  
Output:
Second Smallest : 2  
Second Largest : 5  
Explanation: The elements are sorted as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 7.  
Hence, the second smallest element is 2, and the second largest element is 5.

Input: [1]  
Output:Second Smallest : -1  
Second Largest : -1  
Explanation: Since there is only one element in the array, it is both the largest and smallest element.  
Therefore, there is no second smallest or second largest element present.
