/* -------------------------------------------------- Explanation ----------------------------------------------


Example
nums = {4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1}

Initially:

Index	0	1	2	3	4	5
Value	4	3	6	2	1	1
Iteration 1 (i = 0)

value = abs(nums[0]) = 4, so visit index 4 - 1 = 3 and make it negative:

nums[3] = -nums[3];

Array becomes:

{4, 3, 6, -2, 1, 1}
Iteration 2 (i = 1)

value = abs(nums[1]) = 3, so visit index 3 - 1 = 2 and make it negative:

nums[2] = -nums[2];

Array becomes:

{4, 3, -6, -2, 1, 1}
Iteration 3 (i = 2)

Now nums[2] is -6 because it was marked negative in the previous iteration.

Without abs(): value = nums[2] = -6, so the index becomes value - 1 = -7, i.e., nums[-7], 
which is an invalid index and may crash the program.
With abs(): value = abs(nums[2]) = abs(-6) = 6, so the index becomes 6 - 1 = 5, i.e., nums[5], which is correct.
Why do we make numbers negative?

The statement

nums[value - 1] = -nums[value - 1];

marks a number as visited. For example, when the number 4 is encountered, 
we go to index 4 - 1 = 3 and make nums[3] negative. If 4 appears again later, 
nums[3] is already negative, which tells us that 4 has already been visited, 
so 4 is the repeating number. Therefore, abs() is used because elements may already have been made negative during marking, 
but we always need their original positive value to calculate the correct index.
