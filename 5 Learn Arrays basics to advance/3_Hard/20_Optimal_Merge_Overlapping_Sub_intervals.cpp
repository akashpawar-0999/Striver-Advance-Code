Input : intervals=[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output : [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation : Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,6] intervals.


Input : [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output :  [[1,5]]
Explanation :  Since intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,5].


Input: intervals = [[5,7],[1,3],[4,6],[8,10]]
Output: [[1,3],[4,7],[8,10]]
Explanation: Intervals [4,6] and [5,7] overlap and are merged into [4,7].


Input: intervals = [[1,5],[3,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,5] and [3,6] overlap, so they are merged into [1,6].


Input: arr[][] = [[6, 8], [1, 9], [2, 4], [4, 7]]
Output: [[1, 9]]
Explanation: In the given intervals all the intervals overlap with the interval [1, 9]. Therefore we will return [1, 9].
