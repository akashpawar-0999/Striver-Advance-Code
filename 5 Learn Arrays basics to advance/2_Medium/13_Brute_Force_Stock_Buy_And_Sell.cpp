Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note: That buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Input: prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 = 310 - 100 = 210 and Buy the stock on day 4 and 
sell it on day 6 = 695 - 40 = 655 so the Maximum Profit  is = 210 + 655 = 865.

Input: prices[] = [4, 2]
Output: 0
Explanation: Stock prices keep decreasing, there is no chance to sell at a higher price after buying, 
so no profit can be made.

Input: arr = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 3 (price = 5) and sell on day 5 (price = 11), profit = 11 - 5 = 6.
